# Project assignment
Personal Hobby Project for Modern Web Application

Instructions
Your Person Hobby Program is a program that demonstrates a hobby you have. Make sure your main hobby has no more than 3 attributes, and it also has an array of sub-documents. Each sub-document also should not have more than 3 attributes. (Example: Football main collection teams, a team has attributes (country, year, color) sub-document is player (name and age as attributes)).

Rule: Football (soccer) is not accepted as a hobby (sorry, too many students share this hobby).

During this weekend you will create a headless CRUD application based on your PHP.

The requirements are:

1- A database-driven application.

2- Your application has a document and an array of sub-documents (using one collection).

3- Perform CRUD operations on the application's primary documents.

4- Perform CRUD operations on the application's sub-documents.

5- Use the proper URL paths and methods to perform CRUD operations as discussed in class.

6- Your application must have API hardening.

7- For Update prioritize the full-update function, then write the partial update (it is acceptable to have duplicate code for now).

8- Make sure to upload your work to Sakai, if you are using GitHub that is fine, but download the latest copy of your GitHub work and upload that. I will only grade what is uploaded to Sakai.

9- Upload anything you have before 10 pm, if nothing is uploaded to Sakai you will get zero.

This application is due by Sunday night, Make sure you are awake and with us on Monday.
